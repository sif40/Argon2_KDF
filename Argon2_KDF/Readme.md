# KDF Argon2 with Blake2 hashing portation in C# for dotnet core 2.2

Initial code was ported from the pure Java implementation available [here](https://github.com/andreas1327250/argon2-java).

There are no dependencies whatsoever!

The implementation is fast, but the fair warning as stated by Andreas applies as well. It is not thoroughly tested!

Please check the Program.cs to understand how to use the KDF.

Many thanks to Andreas for his excellent work and his very nice liquid interface.
